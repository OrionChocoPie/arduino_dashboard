# Description
I've been wanting to do a common project with my younger brother for a long time. And recently we decided to do something useful for the house with the help of arduino. It is a possibility to see the current state of the greenhouse from the phone. And so my brother build an arduino device with temperature, light, soil and air moisture sensors. The data is then sent to a database, from where it is transferred to a website and graphs are displayed. \
All code for the arduino device will soon be uploaded to the githab. This repository contains the code for the dashboard. \
